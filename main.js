// Question 2,storing a person's name in a variable:
// let personName: string = 'Abdul Ahad'
// console.log(`Hello ${personName} would you like to learn some python today?`)
//Question 3, Name Cases: Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.
/* let personName: string = 'Abdul Ahad';
function toTitleCase(str: string): string {
      return str.replace(/\w\S*(add here: g, function (txt))// { //this is regular expression,\w\S* matches words in the string.\w: Matches any word character (alphanumeric plus underscore).\S*: Matches zero or more non-whitespace characters.The g flag at the end ensures that this replacement is done globally throughout the string.
       // return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substr(1).toLowerCase();
  //  });
// } /*
/* console.log("Lowercase:", personName.toLowerCase());
console.log("Uppercase:", personName.toUpperCase());
console.log("Titlecase:", toTitleCase(personName)); */
//Question 4, Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks: Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
/* let personName: string = "Warren Buffet";
console.log(`${personName} once said, "You can't make a good deal with a bad person!" `)*/
//Question 5, Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 4, but this time store the famous person’s name in a variable called famous_person. Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.
/* let famous_person: string = "Warren Buffet";
let message: string = "You can't make a good deal with a bad person";
console.log(`${famous_person} once said, "${message}"`); */
// Question 6, Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.
