// Question 24: More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True and one False result for each of them.
//Test 1
var country = 'Czech Republic';
console.log("Is country != 'Czech Republic'? I predict true.");
console.log("The country is: " + country);
console.log(country == 'Czech Republic');
// Test 2
var marksOfStudent1 = 25;
var marksOfStudent2 = 50;
var diffInMarks = marksOfStudent2 - marksOfStudent1;
console.log("\nDoes Student 1 and Student 2 both have the same marks? I predict false.");
console.log(marksOfStudent1 == marksOfStudent2);
console.log("Both the students have a difference of ".concat(diffInMarks, " marks."));
